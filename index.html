<h2>About Me </h2>  
    <p>I am majoring in General Integrative Studies which is a major that has allowed me to study and view different viewpoints from a broad spectrum of subjects. My coursework has included business classes like Manangement and Marketing, psychology classes to try to get a grasp on how people think, communication classes to better improve my communication skills, and even some computer classes to help learn some viable programs that are available in the modern workspace. My work experience includes exclusively volunteer work at the moment with a majority of them coming from volunteering at schools but also I have volunteered at animal shelters, I find that being able to volunteer at these places set me up to learn how to work with other people and get ready to be given multiple projects to work on and find out how efficient I could be at different tasks. My skills include being a hard worker, having an openness to learn new things, and working well with other people as well as working on any part of a multi-person project if need be.
